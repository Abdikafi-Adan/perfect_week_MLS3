## Introduction
I went in it milestone thinking I want it to make a memory game that I would like to play and enjoy, but the problem was that I had too much idés and did not have a clear choice until a friend said why not make one of the anime one piece and its crew and that´s how this game come to be, a game made for amine fans by amine fan.

## UX
When making the game I want it to be simple and easy to understand. In the javascript, I used Object Oriented Programming (OOP) which refers to using self-contained pieces of code to develop applications. the so call self-contained pieces of code objects, better known as Classes in most OOP programming languages and Functions in JavaScript.After some research, I found that this method fittest use for the game I have in mind, which is a game where you match the crew of One piece to there respective pirate flag and most suitable method practice. Home – The home page, we have the game cards. in grid columns that´s 5/4, 20 cards in total. the cards are 10 crew members and there 10 pirate flags.

## contact 
In the contact, we have a contact form where you can get in touch with me so we can work together but also recommend anime to watch.

## User Story
User Questions that the one piece game would answers:

* Looking for one piece game?
* one piece fan-made game?
* simple one piece game
* Is there a fan-made game one piece?
## Features
#### home page

The game, with the help of javascript the user/player, can mismatch until the player matches the cards when a sound will play as to the player they matched right cards together. when the game starts in the background plays one piece music there is also a sound when the user flips a card it even has a game over sound and a victory sound to inform the player when it is game over and game victory where all the cards are matched right. The game also has a timer that counts down every second until the timer hits zero and that´s game over, the game also has a flip count that count up forever card click until victory as to try to get a victory with lest flips when the last game. the game also has a little animation the scales up when hover above using CSS.
#### Navbar
 * navbar we have the game name and link to the different pages.

#### contact
we have a format that allows the user to get in contact with the developer using https://www.emailjs.com/ to sent email directly to my email address.

 ## Features Left to Implement 
* Features left that I would like to add is game Quiz to test the uses knowledge of One piece but also add to it.

## Technologies Used
### HTML
was the language used to structure and present content for the web

### CSS3
was the language used in the styling and formatting the website content, to improve the UX.

### Javascript
was used to make the game logic by matching and mismatching the different cards, the Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) was mostly used.

### GitPod
was the cloud-based IDE used, to write, run, and debug code with the web browser and to create the website.

### Bootstrap
a front-end component library, that was used to build responsive, mobile-first projects on the website.

### Chrome/firefox Developer Tools
was used to ensure that the responsive design worked properly. The developer tools were also used to check if the javascript worked as it should

### GitHub
was used for version control, o have a working copy/snippet of the code and full change history on the local machine.

### Google Fonts
To find the appropriate typefaces for a website of this type.

## Testing
* HTML Validator for testing the HTML code.
* CSS Validator for testing the CSS code.
* Google Chrome/Firefox Developer Tools for testing different device sizes and for any errors found in javascript.
* https://esprima.org/demo/validate.html was used to check if we used the right javascript format.

## testing process
* Navbar Home button and Links made sure that links worked properly and navigated to the intended sections of the website when pressing each link.
* home page Gama cards are tested so it takes 1 second are so before the user can click on another when a mismatch happens so the user/player can memorize the positioning of the cards, I also tested that card that´s face-up is not count as a flip when clicked.
## Deployment
The project was created by using the services of GitHub and the GitPod IDE. The project was edited in Gitpod and pushed and committed to Github repository.

### To deploy the live website on GitHub Pages, I applied followed the following steps:
* Navigate to the project’s repository
* Navigate to the settings page
* Scroll down to the section titled GitHub Pages
* Select Master Branch from the Source dropdown
* The GitHub Pages section changed to inform me that my site was ready to be published at https://abdikafi-adan.github.io/MLS-Project-1-jab-boxing-club/
