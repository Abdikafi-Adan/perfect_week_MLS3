               Planning is one of the most important project management and time management techniques. Planning is preparing a sequence of action steps to achieve some specific goal. If a person does it effectively, they can reduce much of the necessary time and effort of achieving the goal. A plan is like a map. When following a plan, a person can see how much they have progressed towards their project goal and how far they are from their destination.

              Stress may be a natural part of life, but knowing how to manage   it can greatly impact your quality of life. Luckily, planning   is one of the most effective ways to manage stress. Actively   planning, instead of passively reacting, is proven to reduce stress and can lead to more fulfilling, intentional living.
              Planning your working time can significantly decrease your stress level. You’ll find that with a good planning system you are more relaxed and inspired to remain on track and get projects done in order of priority. Working with a to-do list every day keeps you abreast of forthcoming deadlines, with ample time to meet them.
              In this way, work doesn’t have to pile up and with the superfluous time, you can efficiently complete tasks and take on new ones.

              People are not motivated when they do not have clear goals and  do not know what is expected of them. Planning reduces          uncertainty and indicates what everyone is expected to          accomplish. People are more likely to work toward a goal they   know and understand.

              Planning helps you develop mindfulness

              Sometimes we desperately need to unplug, which is why I think   the desire to develop more mindfulness is a surging trend.      Whenever you need a digital detox, try slowing down and         unplugging for at least 10-20 minutes to write down your        thoughts, tasks and plans can help way more then you expect it  to be. We stare at enough glass screens, and scroll fatigue is  real! The simple act of transferring your thoughts from your    head (or the cloud) onto paper can anchor you in the present,   making you more intentional and mindful. While we couldn’t      imagine living without our digital tools (myself included),     this is a great reminder to maintain balance by also writing    things down and planning them out. Write on!  Fun fact:         planning on paper can help you learn and remember more. That’s  right; writing out your plans by hand is beneficial for your    brain!
